# Youtube-Downloader-GUI-Version-0.1
## Introduction
The Youtube-Download GUI app is a Python application that allows users to download YouTube videos in their highest available quality. The application is built using various Python libraries such as `pytube`, `tkinter`, and `os`.

## Features
The main feature of the Youtube-Download GUI app is its ability to download YouTube videos. The user simply needs to provide a YouTube video link, and the application will download the video in its highest quality available. The downloaded video is saved into a ‘Download’ folder in the current directory of the application.

## Future Objectives
The future versions of the Youtube-Download GUI app aim to include the following features:

* Quality-specific download options: This will allow users to choose the quality in which they want to download the video.
* Audio-only download options: This will enable users to download just the audio of the YouTube video.
* Logging logic: This will help in properly testing the application.
* UI improvements: The user interface will be further improved for better user experience.

## Limitations
The current version of the Youtube-Download GUI app cannot download videos that are private or have just been uploaded.

## Installation
The code for the project is provided in the repository. You can clone the repository and run the Python script on your local machine. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries (pytube, tkinter, os) installed.
You can install the necessary libraries using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Here are the commands you can use in your terminal to install these libraries:

```python
pip install pytube
pip install tkinter
pip install os
```

## Usage
To use the application, run the Python script. A GUI will appear where you can enter the link of the YouTube video you want to download. Click the ‘Download’ button to start the download process. The progress of the download will be displayed in the GUI.
